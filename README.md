# Amazon-clone
Welcome to the Amazon Clone project! This is a frontend web application that mimics the basic design and layout of Amazon's homepage. Built using HTML and CSS, this project aims to demonstrate the ability to recreate a complex and popular web interface with a focus on responsive design, visual aesthetics, and user experience.
